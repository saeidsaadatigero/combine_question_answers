# combine_question_answers
this code prepares a dataset of Persian questions and answers, combines them into a single text format, tokenizes the text, and sets up a trainer to fine-tune a pre-trained language model (PersianMind-v1.0) on this dataset. The goal is to create a model that can generate or understand Persian text based on the provided questions and answers.
